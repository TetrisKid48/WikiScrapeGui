# WikiScrapeGui
A GUI for scraping Wikipedia made with PySimpleGui.  
Note: This project is still a work in progress and many features are sure to be added. I'm also planning to release a .exe with PyInstaller every time the code has changed a significant amount.

# Usage
**Note: This has only been tested on Windows 10 with Python 3.9.2.**  
Download and extract the zip file of the repository.  
Type this into the command prompt to install the needed libraries:  
`pip install wikipedia pysimplegui`  
Run `wikiscrapegui.py`  
Enjoy!  

If you have any problems with using the program, please [open an issue.](https://github.com/TetrisKid48/WikiScrapeGui/issues)
