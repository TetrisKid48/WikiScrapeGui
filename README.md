# WikiScrapeGui
A GUI for scraping Wikipedia made with PySimpleGui.  
Note: This project is still a work in progress and many features are sure to be added. I'm also planning to release a .exe with PyInstaller every time the code has changed a significant amount.

# Usage
#### Note: This has only been tested on Windows 10 with Python 3.9.2.
Download and extract the zip file of the repository.  
Type this into the command prompt to install the needed libraries:  
`pip install wikipedia pysimplegui`  
Run `wikiscrapegui.py`  
Enjoy!

# More Information
Page content or HTML code will be saved to an output.txt in the same directory as the program.
